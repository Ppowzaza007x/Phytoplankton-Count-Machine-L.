Script Adaptation
- Customize the load_data() function according to your dataset format. For example:

def load_data():
    # Custom function to load images and labels (counts)
    # Returns X as images and y as counts


- Preprocessing New Images: Write a preprocessing function to handle new images for predictions:

def preprocess_new_image(image_path):
    # Load, resize, normalize image for prediction
